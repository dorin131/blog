When I decided to build my first machine learning model, I realised there are a couple fundamental things I need to figure out first:
- What do I want to predict?
- Where do I get the data to train my model?

Given that the training data is probably the most important thing when it comes to the quality of predictions that you can make, I thought I'll start with researching the kinds of available open datasets that I can potentially use. Some of the sources that I have found are:
- [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/) (~400 datasets)
- [Google Data Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)
