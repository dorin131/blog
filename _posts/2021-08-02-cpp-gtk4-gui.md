### Intro
We'll have look below into how to build a minimal "Hello World" GUI app in C using GTK4.
The example was built on MacOS Big Sur using CMake in CLion, but should work on any other operating systems as long as you have CMake.

### Requirements
```bash
brew install pkg-config
brew install gtk+
brew install gtk4
```

### Configure CMake
The contents of your CMakeLists.txt should look something like this:
```sh
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(HexEditor)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)

find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)
pkg_check_modules(GTK4 REQUIRED gtk4)

include_directories(${GTK4_INCLUDE_DIRS})
link_directories(${GTK4_LIBRARY_DIRS})

add_definitions(${GTK4_CFLAGS_OTHER})

add_executable(HexEditor main.cpp)

target_link_libraries(HexEditor ${GTK4_LIBRARIES})
```

### The code
To create a small window with a "Hello World" label on it, you will need to start with something like this:
```cpp
#include <gtk/gtk.h>

static void on_activate (GtkApplication *app) {
    // Create a new window
    GtkWidget *window = gtk_application_window_new (app);
    // Create a new button
    GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new_with_label ("Hello, World!");
    // When the button is clicked, close the window passed as an argument
    g_signal_connect_swapped (button, "clicked", G_CALLBACK (gtk_window_close), window);
    gtk_window_set_child (GTK_WINDOW (window), button);
    gtk_window_present (GTK_WINDOW (window));
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    // Create a new application
    GtkApplication *app = gtk_application_new ("com.example.GtkApplication",
                                               G_APPLICATION_FLAGS_NONE);
    g_signal_connect (app, "activate", G_CALLBACK (on_activate), NULL);
    return g_application_run (G_APPLICATION (app), argc, argv);
}
```

This example was taken from [https://gtk.org/](https://gtk.org/).
